# Python-Billing-System-With-QR-Code-Generator

This is a Python program that simulates a store's checkout process. The program consists of several functions that are used to read a file containing product information, allow the user to make purchases, and write the updated product information back to the file. The program also generates a QR code for the user's purchase details.

The program starts by importing the necessary modules, including 'read' and 'purchase' modules that contain functions for reading and updating the product information, and a 'write' module that contains a function for writing the updated product information back to the file. The 'qrcode' module is used to generate a QR code for the user's purchase details, and the 'PIL' module is used to display the generated QR code.

The 'generate_qr_code' function takes two arguments: 'user_details' and 'file_name'. This function creates a QR code instance, adds data to the QR code, creates an image from the QR code, saves the image to the specified file name, and displays the image.

The main part of the program is contained within a 'while' loop that continues to execute as long as the user answers "Y" when prompted if there are any new customers waiting to make a purchase. Within the loop, the program reads the product information from a file, allows the user to make purchases, and updates the product information based on the user's purchases.

The program then calculates the total price based on the quantity and unit price of each item, generates a QR code for the user's purchase details, and prompts the user if there are any new customers waiting to make a purchase.

Once the user answers "N" when prompted if there are any new customers waiting to make a purchase, the program prints a thank you message and informs the user that the invoice for their purchase has been created in a text file.

Overall, this program provides a simple simulation of a store's checkout process and generates a QR code for the user's purchase details.
